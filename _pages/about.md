I am a computer engineering student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

Currently, I am doing a [PEY](https://engineeringcareers.utoronto.ca/work-experience-programs/professional-experience-year-co-op-program-pey-co-op/) (12-month) internship at [Advanced Micro Devices](https://www.amd.com/en.html) as a System Software Engineer working on x86 Firmware.

I am open to Summer 2024 Software Engineering internships opportunities in areas of embedded software, ADAS, and computer architecture!
